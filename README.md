üîê Flask WAF (Web Application Firewall)
A lightweight, extensible Web Application Firewall (WAF) built with Python and Flask. This project provides robust protection against common web attacks, including SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, Path Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It features IP blocking, attack logging, a user-friendly HTML-based admin panel, dynamic rule management, a learning mode for monitoring without blocking, and comprehensive testing with pytest. The WAF intercepts and filters requests to a backend server, ensuring only safe requests are forwarded.

üîí Features

Attack Detection:

SQL Injection (SQLi): Blocks malicious SQL queries (e.g., OR 1=1, UNION SELECT).
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Detects script injections (e.g., <script>alert('xss')</script>).
Command Injection: Prevents system command execution (e.g., ;whoami).
Path Traversal: Blocks unauthorized file access (e.g., ../../etc/passwd).
Local File Inclusion (LFI): Detects attempts to include local files (e.g., /etc/passwd).
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Validates POST requests for CSRF tokens and headers.
JSON Payloads: Checks JSON data for malicious content.
File Uploads: Scans uploaded file names for attack patterns.


Learning Mode:

Enables monitoring of attacks without blocking (logs attacks only).
Configurable via /settings/html with a default 7-day expiry.
Useful for analyzing traffic and tuning rules before enabling full blocking.


IP Blocking:

Automatically blocks IPs sending malicious requests (default: 5 minutes).
Configurable block duration via /settings/html.
Auto-unblock after expiration.
Admin panel to view, unblock, or clear blocked IPs.


Attack Logging:

Logs attack details (IP, type, parameter, timestamp) to SQLite database.
Filterable logs in admin panel by attack type, time range, or IP.


Dynamic Rule Management:

Add, view, or delete custom regex-based rules via /rules/html.
Supports multiple attack types (SQLi, XSS, etc.) and actions (block or log).


Request Forwarding:

Forwards safe requests to the backend (http://localhost:8888).
Preserves headers and parameters.


Rate Limiting (optional):

Uses Redis to limit requests per IP (default: 100/minute).
Returns 429 response for IPs exceeding the limit.


Admin Panel:

Responsive HTML interface with Bootstrap and Vazir font.
Features dashboard, blocked IPs, attack logs, rule management, analytics, and settings.
Authentication with username/password (bcrypt-secured).


Testing:

Comprehensive pytest suite covering attack detection, request forwarding, IP blocking, authentication, and JSON/file upload handling.
Tests for admin panel routes and learning mode functionality.




üõ† Usage Examples
1. Testing Attack Detection
Send malicious requests to /waf/ to test detection:
# SQL Injection
curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?query=OR%201=1"

# XSS
curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E"

# Command Injection
curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?cmd=%3Bwhoami"

# Path Traversal
curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?path=../../../etc/passwd"

# LFI
curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?file=/etc/passwd"

# CSRF (POST without token)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/waf/" -d "test=value"

# JSON Payload
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/waf/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"msg": "<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>", "csrf_token": "dummy"}'

# File Upload
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/waf/" -F "file=@test.txt;filename=../../etc/passwd" -F "csrf_token=dummy"

Each request should return a 403 response, log the attack, and block the IP (unless in Learning Mode).
2. Enabling Learning Mode

Go to http://localhost:5000/settings/html.
Enable Learning Mode (checkbox).
Save settings (sets a 7-day expiry).
Send a malicious request:curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?query=OR%201=1"

The request will be logged but not blocked. Check logs at http://localhost:5000/attack-logs/html.

3. Adding a Custom Rule

Go to http://localhost:5000/rules/html.
Add a rule, e.g.:
Pattern: \bwhoami\b
Attack Type: CommandInjection
Description: Detects whoami command execution attempt
Action: block


Test the rule:curl "http://localhost:5000/waf/?cmd=whoami"



4. Viewing Attack Logs

Go to http://localhost:5000/attack-logs/html.
Filter logs by:
Attack Type: SQLi, XSS, etc.
Time Range: Last 24 hours, last 7 days, or all.
IP: Search for a specific IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1).



5. Managing Blocked IPs

Go to http://localhost:5000/blocked-ips/html.
View blocked IPs and remaining block time.
Use "Unblock" to remove an IP or "Clear All IPs" to unblock all.

6. Analyzing Attack Patterns

Go to http://localhost:5000/analytics/html.
View charts for attack types and daily attack counts.
Check top attacking IPs with attack counts and last seen timestamps.


üßë‚Äçüíª Development
Adding New Attack Types
To add a new attack type (e.g., Custom):

In waf/waf_utils.py, add a new detection function (e.g., check_custom).
Update waf/routes/waf_routes.py to check for the new attack type in process_request.
Add the new type to the dropdown in /rules/html.

Extending Tests
Add new test cases to test_waf.py for custom rules or attack types:
def test_custom_rule(client):
    response = client.post('/rules/html', data={
        'pattern': r'\btest\b',
        'attack_type': 'Custom',
        'description': 'Detect test keyword',
        'action': 'block'
    })
    response = client.get('/waf/?query=test')
    assert response.status_code == 403

Notes for Developers

Learning Mode: When enabled, the WAF logs attacks without blocking, ideal for initial deployment to analyze traffic. Set via /settings/html with a 7-day expiry.
Deprecation Warning: The project uses flask_restx, which has a deprecated dependency (jsonschema.RefResolver). Consider upgrading to newer versions or switching to alternatives like flask-smorest in future releases.
Windows Users: Ensure the res/logs directory exists (mkdir res\logs) to avoid logging errors.
Package Structure: The waf directory is a Python package, requiring __init__.py files in waf and waf/routes.


üîç Troubleshooting

Redis Connection Error:

Verify Redis is running (redis-cli ping should return PONG).
Disable rate limiting in waf/routes/waf_routes.py by setting redis_client = None if Redis is unavailable.


Database Issues:

Ensure waf.db is writable in the project directory.
Install pysqlite3 if SQLite issues persist (pip install pysqlite3).


UI Not Displaying Correctly:

Check if the Vazir font CDN (https://cdn.fontcdn.ir/Vazir) is accessible.
Clear browser cache or try another browser.


Tests Failing:

Ensure backend.py is running on port 8888 (python backend.py).
Verify all dependencies are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Set PYTHONPATH to the project root:set PYTHONPATH=.  # Windows
export PYTHONPATH=.  # Linux/macOS




ModuleNotFoundError:

Confirm main.py and the waf package structure are correct.
Ensure __init__.py files exist in waf and waf/routes.


Learning Mode Not Working:

Check /settings/html to ensure Learning Mode is enabled.
Verify the expiry time in the admin panel (default: 7 days).
